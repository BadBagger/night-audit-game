A binding animation production rulebook for 2D character-animation game projects.
Project-agnostic on purpose — port this file into a new project's `docs/` as-is, then
adapt only the illustrative examples to that project's own cast if you want, never the
rules themselves.

Proven across two productions: originated on Department of Impossible Complaints
(a noir bureaucracy adventure), carried forward unchanged in substance into Lost &
Underfound (a Humongous Entertainment-style kids' adventure). The rules held for both
tones — that's the point of keeping them here instead of re-deriving them per project.

**This is a binding production rule.** A sequence is not animation because it has a
high frame count. Every non-held frame must deliberately lead from the preceding
action to the next one. Near-identical generated images that only flicker are
rejected, even if they play at 24 fps.

## The golden review test

Review each action both at speed and one frame at a time. For every transition, a
reviewer must be able to name the visible change: weight shifting, a foot travelling,
a hand preparing, a coat catching up, a face reacting, or an object moving. If the
only visible difference is image noise, framing drift, or a tiny redraw variation, it
is not an in-between; reject it.

Dense animation is a production requirement, but density only counts when frames
carry motion. Engine-generated in-betweens are acceptable for provisional builds
when they warp or move the source pose toward the next pose and pass contact/scale
QA. Duplicates, crossfades, tiny redraw noise, and blur-only frames do not count
toward the frame budget.

Optical-flow or crossfade-assisted in-betweens are review-only if they leave
translucent trails, double limbs, ghost boots, or blended hands. Ghost-free
registration beats smooth-looking interpolation. Runtime sheets must use clean
authored or deformation-based cels until a dense pass can move forms without
leaving residual silhouettes.

Limited clean sheets must not be forced to 24 fps by default. If the runtime
has only a small number of usable cels, set playback timing so each pose reads
before advancing; otherwise the animation becomes a fast repeated cycle instead
of motion. Prefer a slower readable loop over a high-frame-rate flicker.

Readable motion must affect the major mass of the actor when the action calls for
it. A writing, talking, turning, or stamping cycle that only offsets a hand,
mouth, or tiny limb detail will still read as a static portrait with flicker. Key
poses must include the torso, head, shoulder line, clothing, and prop path where
appropriate, then use secondary-action timing to keep those parts from moving in
lockstep.

Adventure-game tooling must produce a motion-delta report for generated or
assisted animation sheets. The report does not replace human review, but it must
catch fake density: if a writing loop, walk cycle, or stamp action has too little
measured per-frame change, it fails before playtest.

Held frames are allowed only when they have a timing purpose: a beat before a reveal,
a weighted landing, a readable reaction, or a deliberate pause. They are never
padding.

## The twelve principles, applied here

1. **Squash and stretch** — Use drawn deformation to show material and weight while
   preserving volume: when an element widens, it must shorten by a corresponding
   amount. A stamped page can compress; a coat can flex; a stack of coins can
   compress under a footstep. Never fake life by scaling the whole character up and
   down.
2. **Anticipation** — Show the preparation before the primary action: a hand lifts a
   tool before it lands, a character shifts onto the back foot before walking, a hand
   hovers before opening a drawer.
3. **Staging** — The action, actor, camera, dialogue, and hotspots must read at a
   glance. Scene dialogue is placed beside the speaker and never covers their face,
   body, or the needed interaction.
4. **Straight-ahead action and pose-to-pose** — Start with readable key poses, then
   author the in-betweens that connect them. Do not ask an image generator to create a
   batch of unrelated almost-identical poses and call the result a cycle.
5. **Follow-through and overlapping action** — Loose parts do not stop at the same
   time as the body. Coat tails, sleeves, hair, ears, carried props, and loose
   stitching trail the torso by one or more frames, then settle.
6. **Slow in and slow out** — Space poses closer together as an action begins and
   ends, and farther apart through the middle. Frame count follows the action's
   weight and comic timing; 24 fps alone proves nothing.
7. **Arcs** — Hands, heads, bags, and thrown or carried objects travel through
   believable curved paths rather than mechanically straight lines.
8. **Secondary action** — Add supporting motion without hiding the main idea: a coat
   tail lag during a step, a wobble after an impact, an ambient head-bob or twitch
   while a fixed character performs their idle loop.
9. **Timing** — Choose the number and spacing of cels to communicate mass, intent,
   speed, and humor. A heavy action gets a prepared lift, impact, and settling beat; a
   quick glance may need only a few purposeful cels. A larger/heavier character's
   timing should read as heavier than a smaller/lighter one performing the same verb.
10. **Exaggeration** — Push key poses enough to be readable and funny, while
    retaining each character's weight and the scene's perspective.
11. **Solid drawing** — Keep the character's construction, lighting, scale, foot
    contact, and camera perspective stable across every cel. An actor must not grow,
    shrink, float, or change anatomy because frames were generated separately.
12. **Appeal** — Poses should be clear, expressive, and worth watching even with sound
    muted. The scene should feel like an inhabited cartoon, not portraits placed over
    a background.

## Walk-cycle contract

A walk begins as a planned action, not a frame quota. At minimum, author a readable
alternating sequence:

`left contact → left recoil/down → left passing → left high point → right contact → right recoil/down → right passing → right high point → loop-safe return`

The exact number of cels is decided by the spacing needed for that action. Additional
cels must make a visible, intentional contribution to the step; they may not repeat a
pose with only incidental redraw changes.

For any freely-walking actor, legs, hips, shoulders, and any carried/worn secondary
elements must participate. Each foot has a clear contact/passing/off-ground role. The
torso leads the step; loose elements lag and settle. The foot anchor stays on the
scene's walk plane, the engine supplies the contact shadow, and perspective scale
changes only with floor position — never with the animation frame. This contract
applies regardless of leg count; a multi-legged actor adapts the same
contact/passing/off-ground logic across however many legs are actually authored to
move.

## Turnaround contract

When a walk-plane actor reverses horizontal travel, they must complete a short
in-place turnaround before the new walk cycle starts. The head and eyes lead, a foot
pivots, shoulders and hips follow, then any loose elements swing through and settle.
Reversing by immediately mirroring a walking sprite is rejected: it creates a visible
snap or backward walk.

## Scene-character contract

**A background plate is fixed.** A scene character is an isolated actor layer,
composited into a stable camera view and clipped or occluded by the real desk,
window, chair, or foreground furniture. Animating a resident character must never
swap, regenerate, or otherwise alter the whole room. The result must be that the actor
lives in the room — not that a different room appears behind them every few frames.

Fixed/furniture-anchored characters receive a passive role-based idle loop even when
the player is not interacting with them — writing, tinkering, checking a result,
returning to the loop. Talk and reaction actions interrupt and resume that loop
naturally.

Any furniture-anchored or "windowed" character (behind a counter, desk, gate, or
similar) must use a layered rig, not a single loose full-body sprite composited over
the background:

- a fixed background plate with that character absent
- the character's body layer, composited behind the counter/furniture contact line
- a foreground occlusion mask (the counter/desk/gate edge) on top of the character's
  lower body
- hands/tools/props allowed to render above the contact surface as a separate top
  layer
- every frame in the rig shares one canvas, one origin, one contact guide — no
  per-frame crop or resize hacks, ever

Every point-and-click room starts as a layered production asset, not a single poster.
The minimum stack is: background plate, environment layers, midground interactable
props, actor planes/slots, foreground occlusion, and hotspot masks. A desk character
must be designed as `desk back/wall -> actor body/hands/tools -> desk front
occluder`, not as a full-room animation patch. A gate character must be designed as
`gate back/frame -> actor -> gate bars/front latch`. If the room has to be
regenerated because one character moves, the scene source is wrong.

Each room should declare its layer contract in code or an engine manifest before new
character animation is bound. The contract names which actors live on contact-Y
sorted walk planes, which actors are fixed slots, which foreground layers occlude
them, and which object-shaped hotspot masks sit above broad surfaces. Broad
rectangular hotspots are temporary scaffolding only; production hotspots are reviewed
against the final scene plate.

## Scene-prop state contract

A baked background plate is a single fused image — nothing inside it can change on
its own. If a scenery element needs more than one state (a gate open vs. closed, a
door, a drawer, a lit vs. unlit lamp, a dust clump before vs. after being searched),
regenerating or swapping the *entire* background plate to show that one element
changing is the same whole-room-swap failure the Scene-character contract already
forbids for actors — this contract extends that same discipline to scenery.

The fix is a small state-patch overlay, not a new background:

1. **Define the element's bounding box or polygon before any state art is
   produced** — the same discipline the furniture-contact line already requires for
   characters. Every state's patch shares this exact box, fixed relative to the
   camera.
2. **The first/default state costs nothing.** It is a crop of the existing baked
   plate at that box — not new art, not a regeneration.
3. **Each additional state is authored as an edit of the source plate at that same
   box**, not a fresh, independently-generated image. Lighting direction, grain,
   color grade, and perspective must match the surrounding plate exactly, so the
   patch seams in invisibly rather than reading as a sticker pasted over the scene.
4. **At runtime, the matching state's patch composites on top of the unchanged base
   plate at its fixed screen rectangle.** The base plate itself is never swapped,
   resized, or regenerated — only the small patch changes.
5. **If the design calls for the transition to be seen, a two-state snap does not
   satisfy this contract.** "Closed" and "open" are the two ends of a motion, not the
   whole animation. Author a real in-between sequence in the same fixed box — a gate
   rising needs frames for the lift starting, the gate mid-travel, and it settling
   into the open position at minimum, not just a start frame and an end frame. Space
   those frames with the same anticipation/main-motion/settle logic and slow-in/slow-
   out timing as the walk-cycle contract, and hold the same standard the golden
   review test already applies to character animation: every frame must produce a
   nameable visible change (the gate has traveled further, not "the same pose
   redrawn"). A prop transition sequence with fake in-betweens is rejected under the
   same Known-failure-definitions entry that rejects one on a character sheet — this
   contract does not get a lower bar just because the actor is a gate instead of a
   person.
6. **Register the sequence the same way a character sheet is registered.** Every
   frame in a multi-frame state transition shares the same canvas and the same fixed
   box/anchor — run the equivalent of `check_registration.py frames` against the
   sequence before it's treated as playable, not just an eyeballed composite. A frame
   that doesn't share the sequence's box is wrong, the same way a character frame that
   doesn't share its sheet's anchor is wrong.

This is the same technique already required for any furniture-anchored character's
occlusion mask (a fixed-box overlay clipped from the scene), just aimed at an element
that changes what it shows instead of what it hides. One box, authored once,
reused by every state and every project that needs a background element to do
something. An instant, un-animated state swap is only acceptable when the design
never intended the change to be seen happening — a light that's simply on or off, not
a mechanism whose motion is the point.

## Ambient motion-layer contract

The Scene-prop state contract governs elements with a discrete state a player
action changes (a gate: closed or open). This contract governs the opposite case:
continuous, undirected background life — rain, drifting dust, water shimmer, a
flickering lamp, distant steam — that plays constantly and isn't triggered by
anything. Twelve principles #12 (appeal) already requires a scene to "feel like an
inhabited cartoon, not portraits placed over a background"; this is the concrete
mechanism for the environment half of that requirement, the same way the walk-cycle
and talk-loop contracts are the concrete mechanism for the character half.

The background plate still never changes — same rule as every other contract in this
section. What's different here is the fix: not a state-patch swapped in on a
trigger, but a thin, separate, always-on loop layer rendered on top of the fixed
plate, never baked into it.

1. **The ambient layer is its own render pass, never part of the plate.** Painting
   static rain streaks directly into a background plate produces a "raining" scene
   that's exactly as frozen as one without any weather at all — it looks like
   motion in a single still frame and reads as dead the moment the player's eye
   rests on it. The plate stays plain; the motion lives entirely in a layer above
   it.
2. **Procedural generation is allowed here — deliberately unlike everywhere else in
   this Bible.** Every other contract requires deliberately authored key poses;
   generative filler is a hard reject for character and prop animation. Ambient
   phenomena are the one exception, because rain, dust, and shimmer have no "key
   poses" to speak of — a seeded, continuously-regenerated pattern (scrolling lines,
   drifting particles, a pulsing light radius) is the correct implementation, not a
   shortcut standing in for one. This exception is scoped to atmosphere only: a
   character, prop, or anything with an intended silhouette still falls under the
   normal no-generative-filler rule everywhere else in this document.
3. **The layer must actually loop.** A seamless scroll/seed cycle, not a
   fixed-length clip that visibly restarts or pops. If the loop point is audible or
   visible as a seam, it fails the same way a fake in-between fails elsewhere in
   this Bible — motion that draws attention to its own mechanism instead of
   supporting the scene.
4. **Ambient layers never occlude gameplay.** Staging (principle #3) already
   requires dialogue and hotspots to read at a glance; an ambient layer that
   darkens, obscures, or visually competes with a hotspot, a speaking character's
   face, or active UI has failed staging regardless of how good it looks on its
   own. Keep ambient opacity and z-order low enough that it never has to be
   reasoned about during actual play.
5. **If the motion is something a player action causes, it isn't this contract.**
   A door that opens on interaction is the Scene-prop state contract. A lamp that's
   always gently flickering is this one. Don't build a discrete state machine for
   something that should just be a continuous loop, and don't build an always-on
   loop for something a player is actually supposed to trigger.

## Talk-loop contract

Do not run one short six-frame talk gesture as an identical infinite treadmill for a
whole voice line. That reads as a game loop, not performance.

When only one short talk sheet exists, the engine must phase it:

- play the full gesture once, preferably as a ping-pong arc rather than a hard
  last-frame-to-first-frame snap;
- drop into a lower-amplitude settle loop using a small neutral/mid-pose subset for
  the middle of the line;
- for longer lines, re-trigger the full gesture near a phrase change or ending beat;
- vary frame holds slightly so every repeat does not land on the same metronomic
  timing;
- never use crossfade, blur, or repeated near-identical cels to disguise a missing
  gesture.

This is a code-side mitigation, not a replacement for art direction. The long-term
fix for repeated performance content is a real gesture pool: multiple registered
short talk/reaction clips per character, plus independent secondary layers such as
blinks, small eye shifts, breathing, or idle sway that do not repeat in lockstep with
the mouth/hand gesture.

### Smear-frame rule

A smear is a single, intentionally distorted transition cel for an unusually fast
motion. It is not a motion-blur filter and it is never a substitute for an
in-between. Use it only at a fast, sudden motion — a pen flick, a stamp
descent/impact, a recoil, a dash — with solid readable drawings immediately before and
after. Preserve the performer's anchored head/torso while the moving limb, tool,
sleeve, or paper stretches along its arc; restore normal volume on the next solid
cel. Do not use a smear for idle, dialogue, a hold, or ordinary walking.

All motion remains subordinate to scene staging. Background and prop motion —
creatures, lamps, rain, drifting objects, machines, indicator lights — can make a room
feel alive, but it must not distract from the current player action.

## Registration and normalization (the gate before animation)

Generated or hand-drawn frames are not finished sprites until they pass registration —
treat every sheet like a traditional animation cel set with real pegs, not a folder of
independently-generated images.

1. **Separate actor placement from animation art.** Placement (anchor point, display
   size, world position) is engine-controlled and fixed per actor. The frame sheet
   itself must never be resized or repositioned per-frame to compensate for bad
   source art — if a frame doesn't fit the shared anchor/scale, the frame is wrong,
   not the code.
2. **Registration guides per actor sheet.** Every character sheet needs an explicit,
   documented baseline: a feet/contact line for a freely-walking actor, a
   furniture-contact line for a fixed/anchored actor. Every frame in that sheet is
   authored or normalized against that same guide.
3. **A frame normalization step, not manual eyeballing.** Before any frame enters a
   game, run `tools/check_registration.py frames <sheet>/registration.json` — it
   verifies identical canvas size and identical contact/anchor point across every
   frame in a sheet, within tolerance. Reject or re-pad any frame that doesn't match.
4. **Cast-wide scale parity, checked, not eyeballed.** A cast can absolutely include
   characters of very different sizes on purpose — that's a design choice, not a bug.
   What must never happen by accident is source art authored at the wrong real-world
   scale relative to the rest of the cast. `tools/check_registration.py cast-scale
   <cast_scale.json>` verifies every character's measured source-art scale agrees with
   its director-declared proportion in the roster, catching accidental mis-scale
   without flagging intentional size differences.
   Pair this with a staged visible-size review: a counter, window, vehicle, or
   foreground-occluded actor can be mathematically correct as a full-body equivalent
   and still read wrong in the actual composite. Important actor pairings need a
   project-specific visible-ratio test or review note.
5. **A visual QA page before anything is called playable.**
   `tools/check_registration.py frames <sheet>/registration.json --onion-skin out.png`
   overlays every frame of a sheet on top of each other, aligned by anchor. If feet,
   head, or the contact anchor visibly jumps between frames, this is where it gets
   caught — not after it ships as a visible glitch.
6. **Animate last, not first.** 24fps timing, in-betweens, and smear frames only get
   added once a sheet has passed registration/normalization/cast-scale/QA. More
   frames on top of ungoverned registration only produces more visible drift, not
   better animation.

### Full-construction contract

Registration proves that cels share a peg; it does **not** prove that the actor was
drawn completely. Before a character state is admitted, review the source strip and
the extracted frames on a contrasting background at 100% scale. Every cel must retain
the complete intended construction for that state: no missing lower body, clipped head,
truncated stack/object, or arbitrary horizontal/vertical cut through the silhouette.

Intentional scene occlusion happens only after the complete actor frame is rendered in
the final layer stack. A counter, gate, chair, or UI may hide a complete actor in the
scene; it must never be used to excuse geometry that is already absent from the cel.
Padding, re-centering, or rescaling cannot repair a cropped actor. Quarantine the
source frame or the entire state and regenerate/re-draw it with generous margins.

The admission record for every generated actor state must name its full-construction
review artifact (source strip plus extracted-frame contact sheet) and the reviewer who
approved it. A state without that review is provisional and cannot be bound to a
playable export.

## Known failure definitions

These are hard rejects, even if the loop looks busy at full speed:

- **Scale drift:** an actor grows or shrinks from frame to frame while standing,
  talking, idling, or walking on the same floor position. Perspective size may change
  only when the actor's world position changes intentionally.
- **Location drift:** the actor's feet, root, counter-contact point, or furniture
  anchor slides around inside the sheet while the engine position stays fixed.
- **Detached or duplicate parts:** a spare hand, arm, hat, head, or second partial
  actor appears because a generated frame carried unwanted remnants. Quarantine the
  cel; do not hide it with speed.
- **Whole-room swap:** a resident character animation changes walls, desks, props,
  lights, windows, or the camera plate. Scene characters animate as isolated actor
  layers only.
- **Patch seam:** a scene-prop state-change overlay (see the Scene-prop state
  contract) whose lighting, grain, color grade, or perspective doesn't match the base
  background plate at its boundary. Reads as a visible sticker rather than the scene
  actually changing. The patch was generated independently instead of as an edit of
  the source plate.
- **Baked ambience:** rain, dust, shimmer, or any other continuous atmospheric
  motion (see the Ambient motion-layer contract) painted directly into the
  background plate instead of rendered as a separate loop layer. Reads as a single
  frozen instant of weather, not weather — exactly as dead as a scene with no
  atmosphere at all, just busier.
- **Occluding ambience:** an ambient layer whose opacity, density, or z-order
  competes with a hotspot, a speaking character's face, or active UI. Correct on
  its own, a staging failure in context — principle #3 governs it regardless of how
  the layer was produced.
- **Fake in-between:** a frame has the same pose as the previous frame with only
  redraw shimmer, texture noise, or tiny clothing flicker. More of these frames makes
  the animation worse, not smoother.
- **Baked contact shadow:** a frame contains its own shadow that fails to stay under
  the actor's actual root/contact point. Shadows belong to the engine or to a
  separately registered shadow layer.
- **Canvas-bottom shadow error:** an actor sheet has transparent padding below the
  feet, but the runtime treats the canvas bottom as the foot-contact point. The
  shadow then sits under empty padding instead of under the boots. Register the
  authored contact baseline and offset the sprite so the actor root is the real
  contact point.
- **Per-frame rescue crop:** a single broken cel is fixed by changing its crop,
  origin, display size, or offset differently from the rest of the sheet. Re-pad or
  redraw the art instead; every allowed cel shares the same registration contract.
- **Truncated construction:** a frame is consistently registered but an intended part
  of the actor is absent or cut off inside the bitmap: for example, only the top half
  of a bottle-cap stack, a missing torso, clipped shoes, or a horizontally sliced
  prop. This is a hard reject for the whole affected state, not a crop/scale problem
  for the runtime to hide. Quarantine it, regenerate with generous margins, and pass a
  fresh full-construction review before using it.

## Furniture and counter actor QA

Counter, desk, booth, gate, and window actors require extra discipline because bad
layering reads immediately as pasted-on.

Before a furniture-anchored actor is admitted:

- Confirm the background plate has the actor removed or neutralized; the room cannot
  change between frames.
- Define the furniture contact/occlusion line in writing before drawing frames.
- Prove the actor's registered root/bounds physically cross the foreground
  occlusion band in the final composed scene. A counter mask that exists but does
  not overlap the actor is decorative, not functional.
- Keep torso and lower body behind the furniture mask.
- Put only the required active hands, tools, papers, or stamps above the writing or
  work surface.
- Confirm every action has named key poses: anticipation, contact/impact, follow
  through, settle, return to idle.
- Use smear frames only for fast tool movement, such as a stamp strike or pen flick;
  never for a held writing pose or ordinary dialogue.
- Review one frozen frame from every action with the UI visible. If the body covers
  the counter wrong, clips off the edge, overhangs the window, or hides behind the
  wrong layer, reject the sheet before motion review.
- Review the actor-only source and its extracted cels before the furniture composite.
  Verify the complete intended silhouette exists before any desk, chair, gate, or UI
  layer can obscure it. A partially drawn actor that happens to look acceptable behind
  furniture is still a truncated-construction failure.

## Hard gate

**A frame that does not pass both `check_registration.py frames` and
`check_registration.py cast-scale` does not get merged into the game.** This is not
advisory — wire both checks into CI or, at minimum, a documented pre-merge checklist,
so every character sheet in every project that adopts this Bible goes through them
before shipping.

The hard gate also includes documented full-construction review: a source-strip and
extracted-frame contact-sheet check at 100% scale, signed off before the state is
bound. Passing anchors and cast scale cannot waive a cropped or incomplete actor.

## Bug-to-Bible rule

When a project hits an animation, registration, staging, UI-occlusion, or
scene-compositing bug and the team finds a fix, the work is not considered fully
closed until the reusable lesson is added back to this Bible.

Do not copy project-specific drama into the shared rulebook. Generalize the learning
so the next project can use it:

- **Symptom:** what the viewer saw, such as scale drift, floating feet, a duplicate
  limb, a full-room flicker, dialogue covering a speaker, or a counter actor clipping
  through furniture.
- **Root cause:** what actually caused it, such as independent frame generation,
  wrong visible-body fraction, per-frame crop rescue, stale actor dimensions, missing
  occlusion masks, or UI placement that ignored staging.
- **Rule:** the production constraint that would have prevented it.
- **QA check:** the test, overlay, contact sheet, mobile capture, or review artifact
  that proves the bug cannot quietly return.
- **Adoption note:** which active project docs, templates, scripts, or CI checks need
  the new rule ported back into them.

If the fix only lives in code, memory, chat, or a single project branch, the lesson is
not captured. The Bible is the durable memory. Future projects should inherit the
rule before they repeat the mistake.

## Required approval evidence

Before a new animation is called playable or published as final, provide:

- A labelled contact sheet showing the key-pose purpose of every cel.
- A full-construction contact-sheet review on a contrasting background, proving every
  intended actor part is present before scene occlusion is applied.
- A normal-speed loop and a half-speed loop reviewed for at least two complete cycles.
- A mobile capture confirming stable scale, anchored feet, and a shadow directly under
  the actor.
- A check that dialogue and UI do not cover the speaking character or the current
  interaction.
- A scene-composite still for every resident/furniture-anchored actor, proving the
  actor lives behind/in front of the correct furniture layers and does not overhang,
  clip, or drift.
- For generated art, a statement that the room/background was not regenerated as part
  of the character animation pass.
- Explicit review of the primary motion plus secondary motion; no crossfade, blur, or
  duplicated imagery may be used to conceal missing action. A deliberate one-cel smear
  is allowed only under the Smear-frame rule above.
- Both `check_registration.py` checks passing — no sheet is "final" while either is
  red.

## Adopting this in a new project

1. Copy `ANIMATION_BIBLE.md` (this file) into the new project's `docs/` unchanged.
2. Copy `tools/check_registration.py` into the new project.
3. Author a `registration.json` per character sheet and a project-wide
   `cast_scale.json` for the full roster — see `templates/` in this repo for annotated
   examples and the schema documented in the script's own docstring.
4. Add a "Current status" section to the project's own copy of this file (or a
   sibling doc) tracking each sheet's name and approval state
   (provisional/rejected/final) as it's produced — that history is project-specific
   and does not belong in this shared repo.
5. Wire the hard gate into CI or a pre-merge checklist before any character art is
   treated as final.

## Current status

Project-specific, not synced from upstream.

No character sprite sheets exist yet — every character and prop is currently drawn
procedurally in code (`Chapter1SetPiece.gd`, `PatrolNPC.gd`'s placeholder silhouette
draw calls), not authored art. `tools/check_registration.py` and
`templates/*.example.json` are in place, and **the hard gate is now wired into CI**
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s `animation-bible-hard-gate` job) — it currently no-ops
cleanly (glob finds no `registration.json`/`cast_scale.json` yet) and activates
automatically the moment a real character sheet is added under `art/`, no workflow
edit required.

One real background exists: `art/backgrounds/pier9_ch1_background_pass01.png`
(Chapter I, from the Blender graybox pass), composited as a single `Sprite2D`, not a
layered scene stack. Chapters II and III are still flat placeholder `Prop`
rectangles.

**The Scene-prop state contract is already directly relevant here.**
`REUSABLE_ASSET_CATALOG.md` lists the shipping container module with `closed, open
doorway, side wall, stacked top` as required variants — that's exactly the
fixed-box state-patch pattern the contract describes, not a case to solve fresh.
Author the container's states as edits of the same source plate at one fixed box,
not as independently-generated separate images, before this prop gets built.

`scripts/Pier9OcclusionController.gd` implements a real-time depth trick (a binary
trigger-mask check at the player's sampled foot position, flipping z-index between
two fixed values) for Chapter I's foreground occlusion. This is a narrower, simpler
mechanism than `specs/DYNAMIC_BASELINE_DEPTH_SORTING.md`'s general continuous
baseline-sort model — it handles exactly one player against exactly one foreground
layer, not an arbitrary number of walk-behinds and actors. It works for Pier 9's
current single-occluder case, but won't extend to a scene with more than one
occluding layer or a second actor needing the same sorting without real
modification. Read this note (there's no separate occlusion write-up elsewhere)
before reusing this pattern in Chapter II or III's environments.

**`scripts/Chapter1Atmosphere.gd` is the real, working example that prompted the
Ambient motion-layer contract.** Its procedural rain lines, light pools, puddle
reflections, and vignette — seeded, regenerated every `_process()` frame, drawn as
a separate `z_index = 35` layer never baked into the background plate — is exactly
the pattern that contract now names and requires elsewhere. No change needed to
this file; it was already doing the right thing before the rule existed to say so.
Worth using as the reference implementation if Chapter II or III need their own
ambient layer (dock rain continuing, boat-deck spray, warehouse dust).
